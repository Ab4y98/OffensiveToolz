tool:
  - name: EDD
    description: Enumerate Domain Data is designed to be similar to PowerView but in .NET. PowerView is essentially the ultimate domain enumeration tool, and we wanted a .NET implementation that we worked on ourselves. This tool was largely put together by viewing implementations of different functionality across a wide range of existing projects and combining them into EDD.
