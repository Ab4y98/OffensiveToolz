  name: Email address only from paste/leak site
  description: >
    An email address was found mentioned in a paste/leak site but
    nowhere else.

    Since the email address was not found anywhere else, this may indicate
    that the address is in some way special, perhaps not intended to
    be publicly exposed/used or targeted in an attack.
