    Such cases have a high likelihood of being genuinely malicious and
    should be investigated depending on the nature of the relationship
    between the target and the co-host. Even if the entity in question is
    not compromised, it's likely to be blocked across parts of the
    Internet due to its presence in these lists and may therefore have
    an impact on the target.
