  name: Remote desktop technology found exposed to the Internet
  description: >
    A remote desktop technology (RDP, VNC, NoMachine)
    was found to be accessible over the Internet.

    Even if authentication is required such systems should not
    be exposed over the Internet due to the risk of misconfiguration
    or unpatched vulnerabilities.
  risk: HIGH
