  name: A target-relevant email address was found in Whois data
  description: >
    An email address was found in Whois data that is directly
    related to the target (e.g. same domain). The email found may
    be that of a highly privileged person responsible for
    maintaining the infrastructure of the target.

    Email addresses are increasingly rarely found in Whois data due
    to GDPR.
