	* NetworkMinerForm.cs: GUI flickering is heavily reduced when loading PCAP files
	or doing live sniffing. This also improves the performance slightly.

	* NetworkMinerForm.cs: SMTP attachments are now showed in the Messages tab.

	the initial part is missing and there are TCP Keep-Alive packets. Thanks to
	Shchemelev Dmitry for reporting this bug.

	* SmtpPacketHandler.cs: Added support for extracting multiple SMTP sessions from
	a single TCP session. This feature is important in order to extract emails sent
	through a SPAM-run. Thanks to Andrew Brant (@threatresearch) for reporting this
	bug.

	* SmtpPacketHandler.cs: Improved extraction of SMTP user names sent directly with
	AUTH command like: "AUTH LOGIN aGVqaG9wcEBpbnRlcm5ldC5zZQ==".

	 - DNS
	 - Messages
	 - Sessions
	The keyword filter allows rows to be filtered based on a keyword. The entered
	keyword is matched against all text in all columns of the tab. This new feature
	has been requested by many users in the past, so it's great to finally have it
	implemented!

	* HttpPacketHandler.cs: Previously assembled data sent in an HTTP session is
	now flushed out to disk when a new file assembler is created for Multipart MIME
	HTTP POSTs. Thanks to Shchemelev Dmitry for finding this bug.

	* PacketParser.Mime.UnbufferedReader.cs: Default encoding is now assumed to be
	UTF8 when parsing binary data as strings. This is useful for example when
	files sent with HTTP POST have unicode file names and the browser encodes the
	filename parameter value with UTF8.
	Thanks to @xredumb for finding and reporting this bug!

	* NetworkTcpSession.cs: Increased allowed level of "out-of-order" for packets.
	Every uni-directional stream now allows packets to be 256 frames "late"
	within a TcpDataStream.

	host's folder.

	* DnsPacket.cs: Bug in parsing of DNS answer records when the record contains
	the queried domain name instead of am relative offset to the query-record.
	Thanks to Ulf Skoglund of FM CERT fame for reporting this bug!

	* NetBiosSessionService: Even more command types are now supported, thanks
	to feedback from Eric Kollmann.

	underlying TCP stream properly in order to handle TLS record breakes on
	non-even TCP packet boundaries.

	* TcpPortProtocolFinder.cs: Added more default TCP service ports: 8021=FTP,
	5223+8170+8443+9001+9030=SSL

	and stored to the file stream assembler object for better file size precision.

	* PacketFactory.cs: Added support for Per-Packet Information header
	(WTAP_ENCAP_PPI) as used by Kismet and sometimes Wireshark WiFi sniffing.

	into the message tab. Added support to extract emails sent with Microsoft
	Hotmail (I.e. Windows Live) into Messages tab.

	* NetworkCredential.cs:
		- Added extraction of twitter passwords from when settings are changed.
		Facebook user account names are also extracted (but not Facebook
		passwords).
		- Added extraction of gmailchat parameter from cookies in order to
		identify users through their Google account logins.
